                There was a time I was living, believing that getting tested COVID positive has become very normal and would not be serious for everyone, considering that 80% of cases tend to be mild. So, with all of us keeping safe at that moment, we planned a weekend outing to attend my nephew’s birthday. And then, the unexpected happened.<br>
                My brother was the first one to complain of cold, mild fever, fatigue. Soon, my sister developed similar symptoms but since both had ice-creams and cold drinks late at night, and the weather had also changed suddenly, we thought it wasn’t a big deal. Maybe just a normal cough hitting us up.<br>
                It was Friday when my brother started feeling severe pain so we decided to go to the hospital for the COVID test where I witnessed
                the worst situation. I never expected to witness something like this. There was a lack of management, people running here are there for help with the hope to get immediate assistance.<br>
Time tested me and later on, I also started showing COVID symptoms and followed by the positive result, and that's when I got a reality check.<br>
As a protocol, we informed all the people whom we came in touch with, and our office team members too. Other people in our apartment got to know from BBMP (government) guys who came and informed the apartment residents to maintain distance from us. And all of it resulted in multiple calls and WhatsApp messages, some are from well-wishers, some from neighbours to warn us not to step outside the home, some called just to confirm the COVID result, and some offering their help.<br>
Our neighbours maintained distance from us, 24x7 we were in close watch for all our actions, and sometimes it felt as if we are criminals rather than patients, trapped in our own house.<br>
The first few days were the toughest, I live with my siblings and we were not feeling well. Thanks to my elder sister who had tested negative and she handled the situation very well along with managing her office work too.<br>
I felt completely exhausted for the first 3-4 days. Taking a few bites of the Khichdi (rice and lentil porridge) on my bed seemed like a tough job to do. Every part of the body had enormous pain as if hundreds of needles were being poked or someone hit me hard all over the body. I had a fever, cold, sometimes dizziness, and muscle pain. I had to add extra salt to the food and I had lost my sense of taste and smell. In 3-4 days, the fever subsided, but the weakness persisted and I got tired even while taking a small walk in my room.<br>
Temperature also increased at night, disturbed sleep, but went down once the medicine was taken. My Oxygen levels constantly fluctuated, sometimes around 90-95 and sometimes fell to 87 at the lowest.<br>
My Nani (grandma) had lost her smell and taste after an accident that caused her severe brain injury and after that, she couldn't smell or taste. We called her one day and told her, Nani ... first time COVID has made us put in your shoes to experience how it feels to eat food without getting a taste or live a life without being able to smell anything properly.<br>
During this time I was continuously practicing yoga and breathing exercises and ate a good amount of fruits on a regular basis.<br>
My mother said that a situation like this made everyone helpless for not being actually there to even help around and it’s completely
true.Family/friends/anyone can't share your pain. It's only you who has to fight physically, mentally by taking all the medical precautions, following all the do's and don'ts, and eating healthy. Even those who are not affected by the virus, are affected by its consequences. If one person tested positive it's not only him/her suffering alone, along with them there are a bunch of people who physically, mentally, psychologically will suffer while taking care of them.<br>
Thankfully, the worst time passed and we started to feel better in a few days and we have stable health now.<br>
It is the anxiety, solitude, and negative thoughts that affect more than the virus. Things are gradually returning to normal. Besides home remedies, we continue to take all other precautions.<br>
My diet consisted mostly of easily digestible and less oily and spicy food for several days, a lot of veggies, sprouts, nuts, dates, water, and plenty of homemade juices and fruits.<br>
We are relieved that we recovered at home rather than being admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms and complications. However, this experience taught me that even a minor COVID-19 infection can be frightening. It's not like the common flu. It shatters your body. We were exhausted as a result of excruciating fatigue. Even if you test negative, the body takes a long time to recover from exhaustion and symptoms. According to the doctors, it will take a month to get back to our normal routine and yoga routine.<br>
Unless you are in critical condition, the best place to recover is at home. Individuals can recover at home with the help of proper nutrition and medication taken on time. In today's world, early detection of symptoms and prompt action can save many lives. Covid is an entirely unpredictable occurrence. The impact it has had on everyone's life is undeniable, and it will undoubtedly be the topic of conversation for the rest of the year, or through life.<br>
This, too, shall pass, and we shall rise to a better tomorrow!
